Recently I ran into [Ben Stokes' Tiny Projects](https://tinyprojects.dev). He created this website were he shares the process of building tiny projects based on project ideas he's had for a long time. Just like Ben I have a list of project ideas and just like Ben I never get to complete them or even really start any of them. The website he created seems to work well for him, so I figured I'd give it a go as well.

Following in his footsteps I decided my first project would be to create a website to share my progress on. And yes, it's the website you're reading right now! 

So I came up with a name. Based on my list of project ideas and searches for available domains, ***notecode.space*** seemed like a good one. For a while I was contemplating ***notecode.bingo***, but the domain name was 20 times as expensive.

Yes, that's a picture of two old man in Romania playing chess. It's what I got when I searched for 'bingo' on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). Here's a cool picture of an astronaut that you get when searching 'space':

Buying [notecode.space](/) cost me €3,63 for the first year.

To create the website I spent some time setting up everything from scratch. I won't bore you with the details, but it cost me about 4 hours. I also wanted to give people an option to sign up for updates on new projects I'm working on. I tried a number of services, and for now I ended up with [Revue](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/notecodespace). You can use the sign up form at the bottom of this page to stay notified.

Finally, I decided to display three random emojis at the top right of the header. Clicking on it will give you three new ones. You can also give it a try right here:

Amazing stuff.
