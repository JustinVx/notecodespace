# Project 1: Creating NoteCodeSpace

Time spent: 1,5 hour
Costs: € 3,63

Recently I ran into [Ben Stokes' Tiny Projects](https://tinyprojects.dev). He created this website were he shares the process of building tiny projects based on project ideas he's had for a long time. Just like Ben I have a list of project ideas and just like Ben I never get to complete them or even really start any of them. The website he created seems to work well for him, so I figured I'd give it a go as well.

## The idea
Following in his footsteps my first project will be creating the website to share my progress on (it's the website you're reading right now). 

## Coming up with a name
The first thing I decided to do was to come up with a name. To do this, I went to [Antagonist](https://www.antagonist.nl) and started searching for available domains. I chose Antagonist because they have great support in Dutch, which is something that I like (I'm not affiliated with them).
I grabbed my list of project ideas for inspiration. When going through the list I noticed a lot of them are related to note taking and my most liked idea is a [Tool for Thought](https://www.forthought.tools) idea. 
After some searching and consideration I came up with NoteCodeSpace. For a while I was contemplating NoteCodeBingo (notecode.bingo), but the domain name was 20 times as expensive.

Buying NoteCodeSpace cost me €3,63 for a year.

## Setting up the website
On my personal portfolio website I'm using SvelteKit and Tailwind, which I decided to do here as well. I spent some time setting up everything from scratch. I also decided to include mdsvex to allow myself to write in markdown.
