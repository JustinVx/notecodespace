Recently I ran into [Ben Stokes' Tiny Projects](https://tinyprojects.dev). He created this website were he shares the process of building tiny projects based on project ideas he's had for a long time. Just like Ben I have a list of project ideas and just like Ben I never get to complete them or even really start any of them. The website he created seems to work well for him, so I figured I'd give it a go as well.

## The idea
Following in his footsteps I decided my first project would be to create a website to share my progress on. Yes, it's the website you're reading right now! 

## Coming up with the name
The first thing I decided to do was to come up with a name. To do this, I went to [Antagonist](https://www.antagonist.nl) and started searching for available domains.

I grabbed my list of project ideas for inspiration. When going through the list I noticed a lot of them are related to note taking and my most liked idea is a [Tool for Thought](https://www.forthought.tools) idea. 
After some searching and consideration I came up with ***notecode.space***. For a while I was contemplating ***notecode.bingo***, but the domain name was 20 times as expensive.

Buying notecode.space cost me €3,63 for the first year.

## Setting up the website
I spent some time setting up everything from scratch. I won't bore you with the details, but it cost me about 4 hours.

### A sign up form for project updates
I wanted to give people an option to sign up for updates on new projects I'm working on. I tried a number of services, and for now I ended up with [Revue](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/notecodespace). You can use the sign up form at the bottom of this page to stay notified.

### Random emoji generator
I decided to finalize the website by displaying three random emojis at the top right. Clicking on it will give you three new ones. You can also give it a try right here:
